## Usage 

Once the deployed site link is clicked, the user can start their search for a new cafe using the search box by entering the city of their choosing. The page will dynamically update and display coffee shops of the inputed city, generating the name and adresses in a scroll list. That same search will also produce the current weather conditions of the city located in the top right of the image below, with no need to make an additional request.

The webapp also auto plays music when the page is initially loaded and will continue to play following a set library playlist provided by SoundCloud®. The user can also control the music should they wish to pause or continue playing the sound.
