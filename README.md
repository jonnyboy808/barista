## Description

The barista webapp dynamically generates all your cafe searching needs based on user input. On initial page load the user's is greeted by barista's animated logo using the Anime.js library and current city is displayed in the map produced by Bing‚Ñ¢. This webapp will display a list of the names and addresses of cafes when a user inputs a city of their choice within the search box. When the user clicks on the search button or previously searched cities, a randomly generated quote of the day will display at the top of the page. The user is also greeted by music that auto plays when the page loads and also auto plays the next song on the playlist to set the mood when searching for their next cafe. Additionally if the user chooses, they may pause and resume the music as they wish. The weather of the inputted searched city is also displayed above the map to make for a better convenience before the user decides to head out to their new chosen cafe.

## Code Example


### Short example of bulma being implemented 
```html
  <div class="flexbox">
  <div class="container">
    <div class="columns is-two-fifths">
      <div class="column">
        <label class="label">Find the Best Coffee in any City</label>

        <button class="button is-info mt-2 is-fullwidth" id="searchButton">Search</button>
```

### Example of javascript code used to fetch coffee shop names and addresses from Bing Map API
```JS
var bingApiUrl = "https://dev.virtualearth.net/REST/v1/LocalSearch/?query=cafe&userLocation=" + coordinates[0] + "," + coordinates[1] + ",5000&key=" + bingApiKey;
    fetch(bingApiUrl).then(function (response) {
      if (response.ok) {
      response.json().then(function (bingData) {
        var coffeeShopsEl = document.getElementById("coffeeShops");
          coffeeShopsEl.innerHTML = '';
          var cafeData = bingData.resourceSets[0].resources;
          console.log(cafeData);
          for (var i = 0; i < cafeData.length; i++) {
            var coffeeShop = {
                name: cafeData[i].name,
                coordinate: cafeData[i].point.coordinates,
                address: cafeData[i].Address.formattedAddress
            }
                coffeeShopsData.push(coffeeShop);
                showcoffeeShop(coffeeShop);
                var cityWordArray = cityName.split("%20");
                cityName = cityWordArray.join(" ");
                Search(cityName)
                }
            })
        }}

Short example of additional styling that was added after Bulma layout
```css
#coffeeShops{
    display:flex;
    flex-direction:column;
    height: 300px;
    box-shadow: 5px;
    border-radius: 5px;
    padding: 20px;
    margin-bottom: 10px;
    -webkit-line-clamp: 2;
    text-overflow: ellipsis;
}
```

## Usage 

Once the deployed site link is opened, the user can start their search for a new cafe using the search box by entering a city of their choosing. The page will dynamically update and display coffee shops of the inputed city, generating the name and adresses in a scroll list. That same search will also produce a randomly generated quote of the day and the current weather conditions of the city searched will be displayed in the top right of the page, which can be seen within the image below.
![Fully Functional](assets/images/fully-functional.png)

The webapp also auto plays music when the page is initially loaded and will continue to play following a set library playlist provided by SoundCloud¬Æ. The user can also control the music should they wish to pause or continue playing the sound.

![SoundCloud Widget](assets/images/music.png)

On initial page load, the user's current city is automatically displayed in the map, with no need for the user to manually set their city after initial page load.
